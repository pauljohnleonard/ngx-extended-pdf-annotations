# ngx-extended-pdf-annotations-demo

This project will add an annotation layer for `ngx-extended-pdf-viewer`. It will not modifiy the pdf but renders the annotations onto the pdf canvas. The annotations
need to be stored by the user.

This is a common use case for allowing users to discuss a document.
